# NextJS/ThreeJS Portfolio/Website

I was loving to test a bit around with ThreeJS, so I decided to create a Portfolio "Template".\
Template, because I will not use it personally and not build out the whole site content - if someone wants to use this, feel free.

The used main model is an Island. _(if you do not like it, you can find other 3D models on sketchfab for free)_

This idea is, that you can fly with a plane around the island and at some checkpoints a popup will be shown, there you can switch to subpages like contact, projects and so on.\
You can fly with the mouse and also with arrow keys.

## Set up locally
Just clone the repo, don't forget to install the dependencies with `npm i` and then simply run the dev-server with `npm run dev`. Straight forward, isn't it?
